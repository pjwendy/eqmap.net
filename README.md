# EQMap.NET - EverQuest Mapping and Protocol Analysis Suite

A comprehensive toolkit for EverQuest server development, featuring real-time mapping, packet analysis, and protocol debugging tools.

## üéÆ What is EQMap.NET?

EQMap.NET is a suite of tools designed for EverQuest private server development and protocol analysis. It provides real-time visualization of game data, comprehensive packet analysis, and debugging capabilities for EQEmu server development.

## üé• Demo Videos

- **[EQMap Real-time Mapping Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eosSt0Vvpjk)** - See the real-time mapping functionality in action
- **[BOT appears in Client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uP2zkLXSPw)** - See a LUA bot appear in the client

## üöÄ Key Features

### üó∫Ô∏è Real-time Mapping (EQMap)

### üìä Packet Analysis (EQLogs)
- Comprehensive packet capture and analysis
- Support for server and bot log comparison
- Session-based filtering and organization
- Real-time packet structure parsing using reflection
- Bidirectional packet support (ToServer/FromServer)
- Hex dump visualization with structure breakdown

### üîß Protocol Library (EQProtocol)
- Complete EverQuest protocol implementation
- Automatic opcode-to-structure mapping
- Support for compression (Zlib) and encryption (DES)
- Extensive packet structure definitions
- Cross-platform .NET Standard 2.1 compatibility
